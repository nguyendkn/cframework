# Project Brief

## Overview
TypeScript Core Framework is a comprehensive framework inspired by .NET Core, providing a robust foundation for building scalable and maintainable applications with familiar patterns and concepts.

## Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- Full-featured dependency injection system with lifetime management
- ORM capabilities with Entity Framework-like functionality
- Minimal API support for building web applications
- Database migration and management system
- HTTP abstractions and middleware support
- Configuration management system
- Logging infrastructure

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance comparable to native TypeScript/Node.js applications
- Modular architecture with clean separation of concerns
- Type safety and strong TypeScript integration
- Scalable and maintainable codebase
- Comprehensive documentation and examples

## Goals
- Create a .NET Core-like development experience in TypeScript
- Provide robust dependency injection and ORM capabilities
- Enable rapid API development with minimal boilerplate
- Support multiple database providers
- Maintain high code quality and test coverage

## Success Metrics
- Feature completeness compared to .NET Core equivalents
- Developer adoption and community feedback
- Performance benchmarks against similar frameworks
- Documentation coverage and quality
- Test coverage percentage

## Timeline
- Initial release with core functionality
- Entity Framework integration
- Minimal API implementation
- Documentation and examples
- Continuous updates and improvements

## Stakeholders
- Development team
- Framework users (TypeScript developers)
- Open source contributors
- Project maintainers

## Resources
- Node.js 16 or later
- pnpm package manager
- TypeScript development environment
- Database systems (SQLite, PostgreSQL)
- Testing infrastructure

## Notes
- Framework is distributed as separate npm packages
- Follows semantic versioning for releases
- Uses conventional commits for version control
