# Product Context

## Problem Statement
The TypeScript ecosystem lacks a comprehensive, .NET Core-like framework that provides integrated dependency injection, ORM capabilities, and minimal API functionality. Developers coming from .NET background or seeking structured, enterprise-grade tooling in TypeScript need a familiar, robust solution.

## Target Users
- TypeScript developers building enterprise applications
- .NET developers transitioning to TypeScript
- Teams seeking a structured, full-featured framework
- Developers building scalable web applications
- Organizations requiring type-safe, maintainable codebases
